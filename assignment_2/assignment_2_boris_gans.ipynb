    "First thing that I notice is that there is not a single missing value in this dataset. Each column has exactly 17,379 non-null entries, corresponding with the value indicated on the Readme file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it's easy to see that most values have already been encoded and/or normalized as well. The columns season, yr, mnth, hr, holiday, weekday, workingday, and weathersit have all been encoded. In workingday, for example, we can see that the min/max values are 0 and 1 and the values of each quartile are integers, telling me that this column takes on either a 0 or 1 (as if it were a boolean). The same applies for weathersit, except each value (1 through 4) corresponds to a certain weather condition, as indicated on the Readme file. The other columns, temp, atemp, hum and windspeed have all been normalized. Their max and min values are (almost) all 0 and 1, and on the Readme file its clearly indicated that each column has been divided by its maximum value, ensuring the new maximum values are now 1.\n",

    "The creators of this dataset pursued normalization, rather than standarization, which is important to note. This may impact the performance of our models:\n",
    ">- Since Linear Regression assumes its residuals are normally distributed, Standarization (rather than Normalization) helps make the cost function more symmetrical and smoother, and therefore allows the gradient descent algorthim converge faster and more reliably. Since these columns have already been normalized, and therefore rescaled to a fixed range, it means that outliers can have a much greater affect on our model. This is why normalization is preferred for distance-based models like kNN and neural networks. \n",
    ">- Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, on the other hand, do not require standarization or normalization. These models split data by thresholds, not distance or direction, which remain valid regardless of the scale or transofrmation applied to the feature. By normalizing the data anyway it likely will not affect the models' performance, although it will remove interpretability in these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, our dataset is in great shape and we do not need to do any feature scaling or imputation. It is important to consider the affects that the normalized columns will have on our model's performance, however. Since the creators of the dataset specified with what value they divided each column by, it's possible to reverse engineer this and pursue standardization if neccecesary. "
